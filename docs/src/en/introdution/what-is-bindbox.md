# What is BindBox?

**BindBox** is a dependency injection container. Dependency injection (DI) is a mechanism that allows program components to be loosely coupled, making the entire program more flexible, adaptable, and extensible.

## Features

- **Framework Agnostic:** Works with any UI or server framework.
- **Strongly Typed:** TypeScript support out of the box.
- **Decorators Free:** Does not require additional parameters in tsconfig.json.
